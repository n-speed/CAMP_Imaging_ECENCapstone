Update for Nathaniel Speed on 9/19
- Taking a look at LSTM variations for developing a competitive study
- Since we do not have a dataset yet to start parsing the parameters we need, I am exploring basic model examples.
This will be as simple as trying to detect between cats and dogs and just learn the semantics of machine learning.
- Until a clear project scope is defined by the sponsor, I will wait on writing test and validation plans for the end output of the model
